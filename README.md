# Smarties Fortune Teller

Demo at https://codepen.io/steve-dave108/full/VwBEVJG

Remember when Smarties' boxes used to have games/puzzles and stuff on the back of them? I still remember one that was like a magic 8 ball and each smartie's colour represented a different answer to a yes/no type of question. I've recreated that virtually using SASS, CSS animations, and a little bit of TypeScript.
